# Codedex Python Exercises

This repository contains my completed exercises and projects from the [Codedex Python course](https://www.codedex.io/).

Each folder corresponds to a topic from the course (basics, flow control, loops, functions, etc.).  
These files document my progress as I build a foundation in Python programming during my MSc Computer Science (Conversion) at Queen Mary University of London.

More exercises and improvements will be added as I continue through the track.
