# Codedex Python Exercises

This repository contains a collection of short programming exercises completed from the [Codedex Python course](https://www.codedex.io/).

Each file represents a small standalone task designed to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals.  
The exercises cover a range of topics, including variables, loops, flow control, functions, and more â€” often overlapping and building on one another.

These scripts document my progress as I learn Python during my MSc Computer Science (Conversion) at Queen Mary University of London.
